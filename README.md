# Face Mask Detection 
Recently the world is suffering from the pandemic, nations are extensively affected by the Covid-19. Individuals are fighting the battle to survive, some lost their lives, or the ones that matter to them while some lost their livelihood. The World Health Organization advised, maintaining at least one-meter distance, getting vaccinated, and wearing face masks. Face masks can be efficacious as a barrier between humans and the virus. The Face Mask Detection performs a critical task in suppressing the transmission of covid-19. Here, I built the Real-Time Face Mask Detector using deep learning and computer vision.
The Face Mask Classifier was trained on the dataset containing 4504 images of people, with and without masks, and was taken from the Kaggle. The dataset was partitioned into 2 subsets: Training set and Testing set.
The accuracy of trained classifier on testing set was over 98%.
For the real-time detection webcam was used, and Caffe model was used for detection of face, which is necessary for extracting the features of the face.
